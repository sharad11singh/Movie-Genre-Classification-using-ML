About Developing a genre classification model for movie plot summaries using natural language processing techniques and logistic regression, aiming to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot synopsis."

# Abstract
This paper approaches the problem of multi-label classification of images, for the specific case of movie posters. Since a genre is quite an abstract concept, it is interesting to investigate if and how features of genres could be captured in the poster of the movie; and with what accuracy the different genres could be predicted. The problem was approached by using a modified DenseNet architecture, resulting in an average accuracy of 26.41%. The genres of movie posters with distinct features could be classified quite well whilst movie posters containing elements of multiple genres were more difficult to classify.

# Introduction
Image classification is used for many applications, including everything from analysis of medical images for diagnosing illnesses to recommendation systems working on images. The problems including image classification can be approached in many ways, where everything from data set, network architecture, the model used, as well as hyper parameters and several other factors play into the result of the work. The difficulty lies in finding the most suitable combination for the problem at hand.
One application of image classification, the one explored in this project, is the ability to classify a movie genre based on it’s poster. The concept of genres are quite abstract, in the way that humans understand them. Not only is it difficult to pinpoint the exact characteristics of a certain genre, but it is also an interesting question whether an abstract concept like a genre can be captured in an image. To make the classification more difficult, a movie can belong to multiple genres with no such correlation among them, making it a multi-label classification problem.
There are many approaches to solve this type of problem, and several have been studied prior to this project. In one paper, a multi-genre classification was conducted, by a comparison between the performance of three different architectures; ResNet-50, VGG-16 and DenseNet-169. They found that the DenseNet-169 had the best performance out of the three, and suggested that improvements could probably be achieved through using object identifier algorithms such as YOLO mentioned in 5.3, finding better data or using other architectures.
Contributions of this work are summarized as follows:

Clean and transform movie poster dataset along with metadata like movie director, actor, imdb rating etc. for the years 1980-2015. Perform image augmentation to the movie posters for genres which are under represented, see 3.1.

Construct and train a deep neural network to classify the movie posters into multiple genres with each image from the dataset having multiple labels. 3.2

Compare the results of different genres and derive insights on what makes a genre easier or difficult to predict, mentioned in 4 and 4.2.

Compare and contrast custom convolutional neural network with a modified version of pretrained deep neural networks like DenseNet, see 4.2.

# Theory
DenseNet-121
Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (DenseNets) attempt to solve the problem of information passed through a deep network vanishing by the time of reaching the network’s last layers. The idea is to therefore connect early layers to later layers. DenseNets connect all layers directly with each other and combine features passed to a layer through concatenation.
The three-dimensional RGB images are initially passed through a sequence of a convolutional layer, a batch normalization layer, a ReLU and a pooling layer. Their output is propagated through a network of four dense blocks which are connected through transition layers. A dense block contains a sequence of dense layers which consist of a batch normalization layer, a ReLU and a convolutional layer. A transition layer consists of a batch normalization layer and ReLU followed by a convolutional and pooling layer. In the end, the output data of 1024 vector is passed through a fully connecting layer with a softmax function.

# Method
Data
The data set used consists of 8052 movies, with their poster images and some additional metadata for each movie like imdb rating, director, actors, run time and so on. Every movie is labelled by at least one of 28 different genres present in the data set with number of genres ranging from 1 to 3, for example Drama and Action. A full list is included in 7.

Most movies have more than one genre. As the data set is too small to train on a deep neural network, and some genres being under represented, there was a need to augment the data and combine the genres that have very few images. The genres Adult, Game-Show, News, Reality-TV, Short, Talk-Show and Western were combined under Other-genre category. The two genres Music and Musical were also combined into one, giving out 20 genres to work with. To achieve a balanced set, images were augmented to get 3000 samples per genre by randomly cropping them of size 150x150. Since one image can have multiple labels, augmenting one image meant increasing the samples of that image for all its corresponding labels. To tackle this issue, the images were not augmented if they had already been augmented for some other genre. This resulted in total of 26049 images as our final input to be trained and tested. The 20 genres are multi-hot encoded and fed into the models. Refer to Figure [appendix:before_aug] and 2 for the genre-wise breakdown of images before and after augmentation.

# System Design 🧩
Modified DenseNet-121
The system consists of a modified DenseNet121 architecture. The multilayered perceptron at the end of the convolutional layer is now consisting of 1024 input features, with sigmoid activation function instead of softwax function since we have the model has to predict values for a multi-label problem. It gives out a prediction score vector representing 20 genres.

The loss function used is binary cross entropy. The system furthermore uses the Adam optimizer to alter the learning rate while doing gradient descent. The model is trained on 70% of the data, i.e. 18234 images, and tested on the remaining 7815 images.

# Custom Convolutional Neural Network
A Custom CNN model was also trained on the same dataset. The model consisted of 6 convolutional layers each followed by pooling layers, dropout layers and ReLU as an activation function. The fully connected layer is then attached with a sigmoid function giving out a prediction score for 20 genres.

#Results
# Model Accuracy 🎯
The accuracy of a model is measured by taking the ratio of top n predicted scores to the number of genres in the ground truth, where is n is the number of genres in the ground truth. If a movie, for instance, is labeled with two genres, the top 2 predictions are considered as the model’s output and compared with the ground truth. Then, if one of the two ground truth labels is in the model’s top 2 predictions, the accuracy is said to be 50% for this poster as one genre was predicted correctly and the other was not. If both ground truth labels are predicted by the model, the accuracy is said to be 100%. The mean accuracy is measured over a test set of 7815 movie posters after each training epoch.
The hyperparameters used for both DenseNet and Custom CNN models were same which included the mini-batch size as 2, learning rate as 0.5, number of epochs as 10, training size 70% of the whole dataset. The Binary Cross entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer were used with the default parameters as provided by pytorch library.

Figure [fig:jonny_english] and [fig:gladiator] shows that the DenseNet classified the movies correctly. Figure 7 was misclassified perhaps due to the dark features in the image which was generalized as being ’Crime’ and ’Drama’ by the model.

Discussion
Any classification problems’ accuracy depends on how well the different classes are separated from each other. In the case of movie poster classification based on genre; there are several challenges to consider. Firstly, as mentioned previously in this report, the genre concept is quite abstract and not necessarily easy to distinctly define features of in an image. Figure 8 is one such example which shows that a human might classify a poster like this to be in ’Sports’ genre, but instead it belongs to ’Crime’ and ’Drama’, which was correctly identified by the model because of its dark features.

Secondly, most of our data set examples include several labels of different genres, of course in different combinations with each other. It is very possible that these genres are not equally represented in the movie posters. Thirdly, the number of genres will impact our prediction accuracy, where more classes lead to a more difficult problem.
Another thing to take into consideration is the data set we used, which is quite small in relation to the number of genres. Since the data set is small, we use random augmentation to increase the size; it is also possible that this random augmenting can impact the performance since different cropping of images could result in different representations of the genres.
One problem observed with the predictions is that some of the genres are not predicted at all. This of course contributes to wrong predictions, since all genres are indeed represented in the data set. One possible reason for this lies in the augmentation of the data set. When going through the data set, we aim to make the under represented genres bigger. However, it’s possible that the overlap of genres makes our approach insufficient. Consider two genres with a big overlap. If one of the genres have close to 3000 examples (which was our set value), it will barely be augmented. Let’s say the other overlapping genre is much smaller, so it should be augmented to maybe 5 times it’s original size, but since the first genre has already "augmented" the movies existing in both genres, the smaller set is barely augmented either.
Since we have 20 genres, the average accuracy of a random classification for a movie with a single genre would be (5%). For additional genres, the accuracy would of course be much lower, two genres already resulting in (0.25%) and three genres in (0,0125%). Considering this, and the fact that on an average the number of genres lied between 2 and 3, the model results can be considered to be better than a random classifier.

# Related work
The following work presented is in some way related to our work, in the case of 5.2 and 5.3, they are two promising methods that could be used to enhance the performance of image classification.

# Genre classification
The problem of genre classification has been approached in numerous studies, for example music genre classification, art classification, and movie genre classification based on other things than posters, like classification based on the trailer of a movie. There is even examples of classification of emotions present in music. All of these tasks have similarities with the task of classifying a movie poster into a genre. However, there are also several differences. For example, a movie trailer is essentially a large number of pictures combined into a sequence, combined with audio. Considering that compared to our task, classifying a movie based on a single image, the data to use for the classification of a trailer is significantly richer.

# Attention methods
One paper, also on the subject of movie genre classification, uses an attention mechanism to solve the problem. Attention mechanisms are used to select input subsets to process, and can be used in neural networks to weight features extracted and in that way create a context of which parts of the input should be emphasized. The proposed method of the paper was to use what is called a Gram layer in a convolutional neural network. First it extracts style features and produces a feature map of a poster image. Next, style weights are extracted which are multiplied by the input tensor, thus working as an attention mechanism during classification. Attention methods seem to have the potential to improve classification where different style elements can be captured for the different classes.

# Object detection
In another paper on movie genre classification , one of the suggested approaches mentioned in 1 is used; the writers of the paper combined the outputs of a regular CNN with the output of object identification using YOLO, giving a multi-genre output. In their work, they tried in total 7 approaches to the same problem, coming to the conclusion that the combined object detection approach was the most successful.
Object detection is a well-studied part of the image processing-field due to its many and highly relevant applications. The specific method used in mentioned paper is YOLO.

YOLO stands for You only look once, and as the name suggests, an image is processed in one single network and during one evaluation using YOLO. YOLO divides the image into bounding boxes and predicts the probabilities of object classes within those boxes. Due to its simpler architecture, YOLO is faster than for example another popular method called Faster R-CNN, and achieves very general representations of objects, which means that it can perform quite well even to data that is quite different from the data it’s been trained on. However, YOLO struggles to identify certain things, for example small objects in groups.
When using object detection, there is the option of using pre-trained models or training a model yourself based of the objects present in movie posters specifically, as it may vary to the objects that can be detected by general models. Depending on your data set, the object detection might also be more or less useful, as in our case we crop the images randomly, and risk cropping the objects up making it less relevant. However, object detection seems to be able to greatly improve prediction in applications similar to our problem at hand.

# Conclusion and future work
Predicting movie genres based on the movie’s poster is difficult based on a range of factors. Since a movie can have multiple genres, features of a movie poster cannot be distinguished as such. Movie posters belonging to different genres can have similar features and one movie poster can simultaneously contain features typical to different genres.
To improve the genre prediction, a larger and adequately balanced data set should be retrieved to train the model on. The choice of genres to classify might also improve the results since certain genres may be more difficult to classify. Furthermore, the system could be extended with an object detection model, so that a consecutive model can learn which objects are commonly represented on movie posters from a certain genre. Since many movie posters depict people, the model could be trained on different characters and their expressions.
